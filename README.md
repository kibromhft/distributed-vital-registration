# Vital Registration System using RMI and RPC  

## Overview  
This project implements a distributed vital registration system utilizing Remote Method Invocation (RMI) and Remote Procedure Call (RPC) protocols. The system allows for efficient data management and access across multiple clients and servers. This repository includes the client, RMI server, and RPC server implementations.  

### Features  
- **Distributed System**: Seamless communication between client and server applications.  
- **RMI Implementation**: Utilizes Java RMI for object-oriented remote communication.  
- **RPC Implementation**: Provides a more general mechanism for remote procedure calls.  
- **Data Management**: Handles vital records efficiently, allowing for updates and retrievals.  

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher  
- Apache Ant (for building the project)  
- IDE of your choice (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)  

### Installation  

1. **Clone the repository**:
